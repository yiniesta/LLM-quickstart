I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

Our waitress was so nice with us even when they lost our order, it didn't even seem like a big deal to us when she told us because she was so apologetic. The only good thing I did eat was the pumpkin pancakes. The whipped cream on top was actually one of the best things I ate here. \\n\\nTheir \\\"cream cheese\\\" syrup was meh. They should use more cream cheese in that syrup to keep the tang of the cheese. One fork dip for the testing and that was all I needed. They should also think about using real maple syrup...... Just sayin'. The hashbrowns were so generously pulled out of the freezer, browned a bit on each side with some thick grease, and put on a plate. Real tasty and this is me being real sarcastic.

I asked if they could make it without the cilantro, and the waiter was pretty rude and told me that they don't make the sauce fresh, so they can't make it without any ingredients.

This location reminds me of a cross between an outdoor sports store, a boat dealership, the Food Network and Disneyland... except for men.  \\n\\nTo possibly receive a 5-star rating: \\n1. The tactical gear/clothing section could use a little work.  I know Bass Pro Shops is more geared for outdoor sports, but  since you carry a tactical gear section, it should be the best if that's what you're aiming to be.  \\n2. Add a fee-based indoor shooting range.  It's a good way for you to bring in extra $$ while also keeping people around to buy your stuff.  Plus, it makes sense since you sell firearms, ammunition, accessories and targets.  \\n3. Expand your horizons/knowledge of outdoor recreational activities.  Include things like climbing gear (think REI).  You could really do some damage if your company merged with REI or at least took some pages out of their book.  \\n4. Offer a loyalty-based \\\"annual dividend\\\"/discount program like the one REI has.  Combined with their legendary customer service and return program, they're my #1 go-to place for outdoor equipment.  You're missing out.\\n5. Some of the gear you offer is for amateur cheapskates.  Offer some higher-end products.  Take a look at the lifejacket/PFD department, for instance.  All that stuff sucks, and is only for someone who is either really cheap or doesn't care about what they're buying.  On that note, the swimming goggle section sucks, too.  I was there to check out some Columbia shirts, then decided to look around for other things.  Since I was looking for some good swimming goggles, I stopped by that section, but quickly left when I realized that it sucks.  Again, you're missing out on sales.</td>\n",

The broth was so herby and flavorful, I couldn't bare to let a single drop remain in the bowl when I was done. There was tons of barley, good sized chunks of beef (but still bite sized), and some other vegetables in the mix. I kept eating it slowly because I wanted to make sure I savored each bite. I cannot compliment this soup enough.\\nMy main course was the salmon served with potatoes, arugula and asparagus ($32). I ordered the salmon medium well, and it came out perfect. A light crunch to the outside, and tender, juicy meat on the inside, and it was seasoned perfectly. The vegetables were delicious and cooked perfectly. They had the right balance of tenderness with crunch. I paired the meal with a glass of riesling ($11), which could have been sweeter, in my opinion (I love the really sweet wines), but it was still a nice wine.\\nThe atmosphere is pleasant, especially with the decor of the panes of leaves and flowers throughout the restaurant. The hostesses were pleasant and even pulled out a chair for me when we got to the table. Our server was also nice and helpful, and didn't forget anything, although he did give us the wrong check the first time (it was the check from the table directly next to us), he amended it quickly and with a sincere apology. It's a restaurant I would come back to because the food was just amazing. I could eat that soup every day for a week and I wish every piece of salmon I ever order would taste like that salmon.

We took the rest of the nachos upstairs and ate them for the next day or so! \\nThe next day (Tuesday) I was treated with a massage! My first one in my whole life! We are on our honeymoon and my bday is today 8/28. THE BEST EXPERIENCE! I now have serious standards. It was $100 which included double the tip for 50 mins! Well worth it!\\nThe next morning we decided to get the breakfast Buffett! Worth every penny! The waiters, the omelet cook, the food, everything was FANTASTIC! \\nThe pool/beach area including the ladies working the towel station exceeded my expectations!\\nAdditionally, they treated us extra well with complimentary items because we were on our honeymoon and my birthday! We are still here and we don't want to leave!

I don't mind a super heavy/dark beer once in a while but it's difficult for most people to spend an evening consuming IPAs.  Another thing was that 2 of the lighter beers were out early in the night further limiting the choices.  \\n\\nOverall it was a good time.
